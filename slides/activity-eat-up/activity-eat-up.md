# Activity: jQuery UI: Eat Up

---

## Brief

An experience in which:

- We see an image of a mouth and a fly on screen
- The fly starts making a buzzing sound on mouse over
- We can drag the fly around on the screen
- If we drop the fly on the mouth, the fly vanishes and the mouth starts chewing (and making a chewing sound)
- Disgusting!

---

## 1. Start a project

Download a template JavaScript (__not__ p5) project and include jQuery  and jQuery UI by adding the appropriate script tags to `index.html`, e.g.

```html
<script
src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"
integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8="
crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css" />

<script
src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js"
integrity="sha256-VazP97ZCwtekAsvgPBSUwPFKdrwD3unUfSGVYrahUqU="
crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

- Note that we're using CDN versions of the two libraries here
- Note how jQuery UI requires the use of a stylesheet as well as the JavaScript file

---

## 2. Create the basic HTML content

1. Add two image tags to `index.html`:
  1. One should be an image of an open mouth with an `id` of `mouth`
  1. One should be an image of a fly with an `id` of `fly`
  1. (Obviously you'll need to put the images themselves in the appropriate folder and link to it)

(To save time, use the images here: https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263-2019/tree/master/activities/jqueryui/eat-up/assets/images)

You should now be able to view the page in your browser, and see a mouth and a fly.

???

__Solution:__

```html
<img id="mouth" src="assets/images/mouth-open.png">
<img id="fly" src="assets/images/fly.png">
```

---

## 3. Start the script

1. Add the basic "document ready" code to your `script.js` so you're ready to start writing code

???

__Solution:__

```javascript
$(document).ready(setup);

function setup() {
  // Code to run on the page goes here
}
```

---

## 4. Get references to the mouth and fly elements on the page

1. Declare two variables at the top of your program to store the mouth and fly elements (since we're using jQuery you should prefix the variable names with `$`)
1. In your "document ready" function, use jQuery to select the two elements on the page and store them in the appropriate variables

???

__Solution:__

```javascript
$mouth = $('#mouth');
$fly = $('#fly');
```

---

## 5. Make the fly draggable

1. Use jQuery UI to make the fly element draggable (look it up in the demo documentation to see how - it's very simple)

You should now be able to drag the fly around on the screen!

???

__Solution:__

```javascript
$fly.draggable();
```

---

## 6. Make the mouth droppable

1. Use jQuery UI to make the mouth droppable (look it up)
1. Add an option when configuring the droppable to call a function when an element is dropped (look it up)
1. Define the handler function that will be called on dropping and have it `console.log()` something to show it works
1. Take special note of the parameters that this handler will receive by default (can be seen in the demos or the API)

???

__Solution:__

```javascript
mouth.droppable({
  drop: onDrop
});

...

function onDrop(event,ui) {
  console.log("Dropped!");
}
```

---

## 7. Make the fly vanish when it's dropped on the mouth

1. In your drop handler function, use jQuery's `remove()` function to remove the fly when it's dropped (note that you can use `$fly` to target the fly or you can use `ui.draggable` to generically target the element that was dropped, the latter is better)

Now when you drag the fly onto the mouth it should vanish!

???

__Solution:__

```javascript
function onDrop(event,ui) {
  console.log("Dropped!");
  ui.draggable.remove();
}
```

---

## 8. Make the mouth chew when it has eaten a fly

1. After removing the fly, use `setInterval()` to repeated call a `chew` function at some interval (you can tweak the number to your liking)
1. Define the `chew()` function in your code
1. In the function you should:
  1. Check if the current image displayed in the mouth element is open (use jQuery's `attr()` function to check if the `src` attribute matches the path of the open mouth image)
  1. If it is, swap the image to the closed image (use `attr()` to __set__ the `src` property)
  1. If it isn't it must be closed, so swap the image to the open image

Now when you drag the fly onto the mouth it should vanish and the mouth should start "chewing"!

???

__Solution:__

```javascript
function onDrop(event,ui) {
  ui.draggable.remove();
  setInterval(chew,250);
}

function chew() {
  if ($mouth.attr('src') === 'assets/images/mouth-open.png') {
    $mouth.attr('src','assets/images/mouth-closed.png');
  }
  else {
    $mouth.attr('src','assets/images/mouth-open.png');
  }
}
```

## 9. Add sound effects

1. Add a buzzing sound effect to the program, set it to loop and add a 'mousedown' event to the fly element that plays the buzzing sound (to avoid problems with triggering sounds before any interaction)
1. Stop/pause the buzzing sound effect when the user drops the fly on the mouth and it vanishes
1. Add a chewing sound effect to the program, play it when the user first drops the fly on the mouth, and then play it every time the mouth is changed to the closed image

(You can get sounds for this here: https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263-2019/tree/master/activities/jqueryui/eat-up/assets/sounds)

Now when you run the page you should hear buzzing, and when you drop the fly on the mouth it should vanish and stop buzzing, and a chewing sound should start. Done!

???

__Solution:__

```javascript
// At top of program
let buzzSFX = new Audio("assets/sounds/buzz.mp3");
let crunchSFX = new Audio("assets/sounds/crunch.wav");

...

// In document ready
buzzSFX.loop = true;

$fly.on('mousedown',function () {
  buzzSFX.play();
});

...

// In the drop handler function
crunchSFX.play();

...

// In the mouse closed part of your if state in the interval function
crunchSFX.play();
```

## Done!

Nice job!
