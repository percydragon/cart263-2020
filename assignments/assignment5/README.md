## Brief

- Incorporate annyang! into the experience by allowing players to:
  - Give up on a round by saying "I give up". This should shake the correct answer and then generate a new round
  -  Ask to hear the (reversed) name of the animal again by saying "Say it again"
  - Speak their guesses in the form "I think it is X" where X is the name of the animal and have the answer be checked just like it would be with a click on the correct button
- Include a running score on the page of consecutive correct answers, reset to 0 if they get one wrong or they give up

__NOTE:__ This brief is the bare minimum of additions in order to pass, please always use these assignments as a playground to try out more than the bare minimum!
