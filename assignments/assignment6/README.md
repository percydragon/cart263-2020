## Brief

- Add an extra descriptive element (or more) to the condiment by including another dataset from the [corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/tree/master/data)
- Fix the issue of using 'a' instead of 'an' by writing code that checks if the word following an indefinite article (e.g. 'a') starts with a vowel and use 'an' instead in that case
- Allow the user to refresh the description by clicking on the page rather than having to reload it

__NOTE:__ This brief is the bare minimum of additions in order to pass, please always use these assignments as a playground to try out more than the bare minimum!
